            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The sport of whitewater rafting was in its infant stages <br>
               in 1962. That spring George Armstrong placed a small raft <br>
               into the Stanislaus River near Yosemite National Park and <br>
               ventured into the unknown. He lived to tell about it and <br>
               fell in love with rivers and rafting.Soon he and his family<br> 
               were sharing their new found love with others. A lot has been<br>
               learned since those early days of rafting, but the same joy and<br>
               excitement initially experienced on the river has only grown. And<br>
               so has the All-Outdoors family.Now, over 60 years later, three<br>
               generations of Armstrongs and the All-Outdoors staff welcome more<br>
               than 10,000 guests on river trips throughout California each year!.</p>
