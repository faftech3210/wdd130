                    <p>The sport of whitewater rafting was in its infant stages <br>
                        in 1962. That spring George Armstrong placed a small raft <br>
                        into the Stanislaus River near Yosemite National Park and <br>
                        ventured into the unknown. He lived to tell about it and <br>
                        fell in love with rivers and rafting.Soon he and his family<br> 
                        were sharing their new found love with others. A lot has been<br>
                        learned since those early days of rafting, but the same joy and<br>
                        excitement initially experienced on the river has only grown. And<br>
                        so has the All-Outdoors family.Now, over 60 years later, three<br>
                        generations of Armstrongs and the All-Outdoors staff welcome more<br>
                        than 10,000 guests on river trips throughout California each year!.</p>
